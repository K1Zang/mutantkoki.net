          Tezlive token is an erc-20 based token with a total supply of 1 billion, which will be
          built on the etherium blockchain. 70 percent of the Tezlive token will be distributed to
          ecosystem financing, 20 percent will be given to mutant koki and mutant coci cat owners,
          and 10 percent will be given to the founders. Immediately following the launch of the
          Tezlive token, a marketplace will be created that allows people to shoot and sell videos
          of their talents. Buying and selling transactions in this marketplace will be thanks to
          the tezlive token built on the etherium blockchain.
