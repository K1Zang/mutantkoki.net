          The mouse named Koki is eaten by her lover, the cat. Witnessing the death of her lover,
          Koki looks for ways to end her own life. He doesn't want to be eaten by a cat after being
          killed by the cat he loves. He jumps from tall buildings but still doesn't die. Finally,
          he enters a pharmacy warehouse and manages to drink the medicine he put in his eye without
          being caught by anyone. A side effect of the drug is that it mutates Koki. Unable to die
          properly, Koki adopts the moniker "Mutant Koki". And this medicine he drinks not only
          mutates himself, but also infects his other friends. There are 5000 mice in total in the
          city, and it infects all of them.
